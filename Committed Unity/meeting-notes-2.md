# Mentor Check-In #2

## Navigation Bar Design
* Title bar (image) is not that effective
* Play with relative size, currently the nav bar is smaller so seems less important 
    * Seems like just tabs instead of nav bar
* Title of the page should be in the center / more apparent

## Admin Accounts
* Can preload admin users for purpose of demonstration, but fine not to change

## Recommendation System
* Current state is enough for the project -- don’t necessarily need to make it super complicated
* Differentiate between star (limit to certain amount) and follow for tags
* Description for each tag could be helpful 

## Todos for Final Product
* Styling (ex. layout, etc.)
* Profile page shouldn’t be including users -- separate that into a different tab
* Consider the user base and adjust the website based on that
