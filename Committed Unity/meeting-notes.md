# Mentor Check-In #1

## Topic recommendation 
- Implementation during the time frame (~5 weeks) we have
- Designs considered: lookup table vs more complex (collaborative filtering without ML)
    - Hardcoded lookup table is sufficient for MVP
    - Final product - slightly more robust than a hardcoded table - could be dynamic?
        - Collaborative filtering could be feasible next step
        - Do not need to implement ML
- Will this end up recommending all topics?
    - Can address this by allowing users to choose x topics to follow, and of those star certain ones to give priority

## Gamification 
- If users reach a certain status, any increased ability to contribute? Or is just for visuals
- Instead of having gamification being tied to the city for rewards, award users in the app
    - Ex. making users who engage a lot a moderator, starred comments / other UI distinctions to benefit platform
- Ethical tradeoff: voice chamber - if give more weight to people to participate more, could flood app with their opinions
