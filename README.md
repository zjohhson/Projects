# Projects
This repository contains code from various projects, both collaboratively and individually, that I have worked on in my classes at MIT. Fritter is an individual project that I am currently working on for my class 6.170 (Software Studio, taken Fall 2021). You Grow Girl! was a collaborative project that I worked on for my class 6.08 (Introduction to EECS via Interconnected Embedded Systems, taken Spring 2021). Crossword was a collaborative project that I worked on for my class 6.031 (Elements of Software Construction, taken Fall 2020).
